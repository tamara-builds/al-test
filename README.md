# 🏛️ Alabama legislation file tree

Formatted, versioned legislative data for Alabama. Part of the [govbot](https://github.com/chihacknight/govbot) civic data project.

This [Chi Hack Night](https://chihacknight.com) project transforms **Open States** scraper output into a git-native, filesystem-friendly structure.

This enables a few things:

- **Free Unlimited Git Powered Legislative Data Analysis**: The raw data is as simple as a `git pull`.
- **Event Source Data Analysis**: Replay a session from our immutable event logs, making for a paper-trail.
- **Easier AI Analysis**: Plain text legislation with files/folders works with a number of different tools.
- **Decentralize Government Data**: Because We the People

## How to use

Just `git clone` this repo — everything under `country:us/` is the dataset.

## ⚙️ Where This Repo Fits

This is the **formatted data repo** for Alabama — one of two repos per jurisdiction:

1. **Scraper repo** (`govbot-openstates-scrapers/al-legislation`) — runs [OpenStates](https://github.com/openstates/openstates-scrapers) scrapers, produces raw scraped JSON
2. **This repo** (`al-legislation`) — reads the scraper repo's output and:
   1. 🧼 **Sanitizes** the data by removing ephemeral fields (`_id`, `scraped_at`) for deterministic output
   2. 🧠 **Formats** it into a blockchain-style, versioned structure with incremental processing
   3. 🔗 **Links** events to bills and sessions automatically
   4. 🩺 **Monitors** data quality by tracking orphaned bills
   5. 📄 **Extracts** full text from bills, amendments, and supporting documents (PDFs, XMLs, HTMLs)
   6. 📂 **Commits** the formatted output and extracted text nightly (or manually), with auto-save

This split keeps scraping (which can be blocked/rate-limited per state) independent from formatting/extraction, and keeps every jurisdiction's repo consistent, auditable, and easy to maintain.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🔄 Incremental Processing** - Only processes new or updated bills (no duplicate work!)
- **💾 Auto-Save Failsafe** - Commits progress during long text-extraction runs, and auto-restarts if a run times out
- **🩺 Data Quality Monitoring** - Tracks orphaned bills (votes/events without bill data)
- **🔗 Bill-Event Linking** - Automatically connects committee hearings and events to bills
- **⏱️ Timestamp Tracking** - Two-level timestamps for logs and text extraction
- **🎯 Multi-Format Text Extraction** - XML → HTML → PDF with fallbacks
- **📊 Detailed Error Logging** - Categorized errors for easy debugging

## 🔧 Setup & Configuration

This repo is generated and kept up to date by [`actions/pipeline-manager`](https://github.com/chihacknight/govbot/tree/main/actions/pipeline-manager) in the main `chihacknight/govbot` repo — it is not set up by hand.

To change Alabama's configuration (branch pinning, runner, enabled jobs, labels), edit its entry in [`chn-openstates-files.yml`](https://github.com/chihacknight/govbot/blob/main/actions/pipeline-manager/chn-openstates-files.yml) and re-run `apply.py` — don't hand-edit the workflow files in this repo directly, since the next `apply.py` run will overwrite them.

Current settings for Alabama:

- **State code**: `al`
- **Toolkit branch**: `main`
- **Scraper repo**: `govbot-openstates-scrapers/al-legislation`

---

## 📅 Workflow Schedule

Two independent workflows:

### `format.yml` — Format Data (12:00 PM UTC daily)

Pulls the latest scraped data from the scraper repo, sanitizes it, formats it into `country:us/state:al/sessions/...`, links events, and updates orphan tracking.

### `extract-text.yml` — Text Extraction (8:00 AM UTC daily)

Downloads and extracts full bill text into each bill's `files/` folder. Runs independently of formatting since it can take hours on large states. If a run times out or fails, a follow-up job automatically re-triggers it — incremental processing means it resumes rather than starting over.

Both can also be run manually via **Actions → [workflow] → Run workflow**.

## 📦 Output Format

### Metadata Output (`country:us/state:*/`)

Formatted metadata is saved to `country:us/state:al/sessions/`, organized by session and bill.

Each bill directory contains:

- `metadata.json` – structured information about the bill **with `_processing` timestamps**
- `logs/` – action, event, and vote logs
- `files/` – original documents and extracted text

**Example `metadata.json` structure:**

```json
{
  "identifier": "HB 1234",
  "title": "Example Bill",
  "_processing": {
    "logs_latest_update": "2025-01-15T14:30:00Z",
    "text_extraction_latest_update": "2025-01-16T08:00:00Z"
  },
  "actions": [
    {
      "description": "Introduced in House",
      "date": "2025-01-01",
      "_processing": {
        "log_file_created": "2025-01-01T12:00:00Z"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Text Extraction Output (`files/`)

When text extraction runs, each bill directory also includes:

- `files/` – original documents and extracted text
  - `*.pdf` – Original PDF documents
  - `*.xml` – Original XML bill text
  - `*.html` – Original HTML documents
  - `*_extracted.txt` – Plain text extracted from documents

### Error Output (`.windycivi/errors/`)

Failed items are logged separately:

- `.windycivi/errors/text_extraction_errors/download_failures/` – Documents that couldn't be downloaded
- `.windycivi/errors/text_extraction_errors/parsing_errors/` – Documents that couldn't be parsed
- `.windycivi/errors/text_extraction_errors/missing_files/` – Bills missing source files
- `.windycivi/errors/missing_session/` – Bills without session information

### Data Quality Monitoring (`orphaned_placeholders_tracking.json`)

Tracks **orphaned bills** - bills that have vote events or hearings but no actual bill data. Check this file periodically to identify data quality issues:

```json
{
  "HB999": {
    "first_seen": "2025-01-21T12:00:00Z",
    "last_seen": "2025-01-23T14:30:00Z",
    "occurrence_count": 3,
    "session": "103",
    "vote_count": 2,
    "event_count": 0,
    "path": "country:us/state:al/sessions/103/bills/HB999"
  }
}
```

**What to look for:**

- Bills with high `occurrence_count` (3+) are **chronic orphans** - likely data quality issues
- Check for typos in bill identifiers or scraper configuration
- Orphans automatically resolve when the bill data arrives! 🎉

📖 See [orphan tracking documentation](https://github.com/chihacknight/govbot/blob/main/actions/format/docs/orphan_tracking.md) for more details.

## 🪵 Logging & Error Handling

### Formatting Logs

- Logs are saved per bill under `logs/`
- Processing summary shows total bills, events, and votes processed
- Session mapping tracks bill-to-session relationships
- **Orphan tracking** shows new, existing, and resolved orphans

### Text Extraction Logs

- Download attempts with success/failure status
- Extraction method used (XML, HTML, PDF)
- Error details saved to `.windycivi/errors/text_extraction_errors/`
- Summary reports include total documents processed, successful extractions by type, skipped (already extracted) documents, and failed downloads/extractions with reasons

Both workflows are fault-tolerant — if a single bill fails, the run continues for all others.

## 📄 Supported Document Types

| Type           | Format   | Extraction Method   | Notes                          |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Bills**      | XML      | Direct XML parsing  | Primary bill text              |
| **Bills**      | PDF      | pdfplumber + PyPDF2 | With strikethrough detection   |
| **Bills**      | HTML     | BeautifulSoup       | Fallback for HTML-only sources |
| **Amendments** | PDF      | pdfplumber + PyPDF2 | State amendments only          |
| **Documents**  | PDF/HTML | Auto-detect         | CBO reports, committee reports |

**Note**: Federal `congress.gov` HTML amendments are currently skipped due to blocking issues. XML bill versions from `govinfo.gov` work perfectly.

## 📊 Monitoring & Debugging

### Check Workflow Status

- GitHub Actions tab shows all runs
- Green checkmark = success
- Red X = failure (click for logs)

### Check Data Quality

1. Review `.windycivi/errors/orphaned_placeholders_tracking.json` for data issues
2. Look for chronic orphans (occurrence_count >= 3)
3. Check `.windycivi/errors/` for formatting/extraction errors

### Common Issues

**No new data showing up**:

- Check the scraper repo (`govbot-openstates-scrapers/al-legislation`) actually got fresh data first — this repo only formats what that repo has already scraped
- Check `.windycivi/last-processed-sha` against the scraper repo's latest commit

**Text extraction fails or times out**:

- Check `.windycivi/errors/text_extraction_errors/` for details
- A timed-out/failed run auto-restarts and resumes (incremental) — no manual re-run needed
- Review error logs for specific bills

**Orphaned bills appear**:

- Check `orphaned_placeholders_tracking.json` for details
- Verify bill identifiers match between scraper and vote/event data
- Bills may auto-resolve on the next format run if it's a timing issue
